Variable Rules
1. Cannot be a resevered keyword
    e.g.: if, else, var, etc

2. Should be Meaningful --> firstName
    e.g.: Not Meaningful: a, b, x, a1, etc

3. Cannot start with a number

4. Cannot contain a space or hyphen( - )

        Use camel notation
        e.g.: let firstName 
        (first letter of first word should be lower case, and the first letter of every word after should be upper case)

5. Case sensitive
    let firstName != let FirstName

6. Declaring multiple Variable
    - On one line and separate using a comma
        e.g.: let firstName, lastName; (Not initalized/Undefined)
                let firstName = 'Jules', lastName = 'Tahal'; (Initalized/Undefined)

        BEST PARTICE - Declare each variable on a single line
            e.g.: let firstName = 'Jules';
                     let lastName = 'Tahal';
