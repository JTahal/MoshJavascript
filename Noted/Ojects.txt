An object in JS is like an object in real life

e.g.: A Person
    a person has a name, age, address etc <-- these are a property of a person

e.g.: 

let name = "Jules";
let age = 36;
instead of declearing two variables that are related (in this case a person propertie/keys), we can declear a person object.
{ } <--- object Literal
let or const person = {
    name: 'jules',
    age: 36
    };

console.log(person)

Change the name of person
    1. Dot notation
    person.name = "john";
    console.log(person.name);

    2. Bracket Notation 
    person['name'] = 'Jules';
    console.log(person.name);

    Dot Notation is mostly use
