let name = "Jules"; //String Litersl
let age = 30; //Number Literal
let isApproved = true; // Boolean Literal
let firstName; // Undefined or let firstName = undefined;
let selectedColor= null;


typeof operator

e.g.: (type in console)
>typeof age
< "number"

> age = 30.1
<30.1
>typeof age
< "number"

NB: In JavaScript there isn't floating point numbers (30.1) and integers
ALL NUMBER ARE OF TYPE NUMBER

> typeof isApproved
< "boolean"

> typeof firstName
< "undefined"

> typeof selectedColor
< "object"
